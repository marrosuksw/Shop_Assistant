# Shop Assistant

This is a terminal-based application written in C++ that serves as 
an assistant for shop clerks in making orders for clients in a car part shop.
Functions include:
- viewing available parts, their price, quantity
- ordering parts with given quantity
- creating an invoice with user-provided data
- mock notification system for ordering out-of-stock parts

To access the application, the program requires a login and a password.
Both login credentials are specified in the assistantdb.txt file.
This project was required to implement a .txt file database system. Login data,
car part data and new invoices are stored in .txt files.
